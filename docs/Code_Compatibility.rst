Code Compatibility
========================

:code:`PDynA` is built with mostly internalized functions and attributes, and only uses :code:`pymatgen` and 
:code:`ASE` for their structure objects as output for user to save and use in other platforms. 
This is the same for the other dependencies. If you are receiving dependency-related errors when using
:code:`PDynA`, please raise an Issue in GitHub.
